# Angular 4 Paypal Checkout

A project demonstrating Angular 4 and Paypal instant checkout integration.<br />
<em>Note: Angular 5 was released, I have updated this sample project to support it. Learn [https://blog.angular.io/version-5-0-0-of-angular-now-available-37e414935ced](more) about the changes. This project will still work with Angular 2 and 4.
